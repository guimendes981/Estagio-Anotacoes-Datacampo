# Lesson1

- TypeScript can compile JS to be compatible with older browsers

- We can use 'tsc main.ts' to compile our TS code to JS

- And then we can use 'tsc main.ts -w' to watch for changes and compile automatically

- All ts files go in a src folder and all html files go in a build folder

- Use 'tsc --init' to create a tsconfig.json file

- By changing the target in the tsconfig.json file we can change the version of JS we want to compile to, for example 'es5' which is for older browsers

- JS ignores strings + numbers, but TS doesn't
